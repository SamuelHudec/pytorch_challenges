# Pytorch Challenges

This project was created as an initiative to kick myself for deeper understanding of the pytorch library. 
I asked my skilled colleague to create challenges for me. Knowledge of programming and mathematics is required.

Each task is specified in a `template.py` file in challenge folder. Based on it, I should be able to compose a solution.
Remember template is only __hint file__. Of course every one can use his creativity to deliver running solution.

## First Challenge

This one is simple as possible. Code "MultiLayerPerceptron" that means simple neural network for classification task.
I found as challenge is to create neural network by list, use different activation function and apply batch normalisation. 
Also challenge learns me to create fake data, what is baseline for test composed `nn.Module` model. 
When I finished task I can play with some famous data as `CIFAR10` and more.
